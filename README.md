Surrounded by art influences all my life, from my father, to my grandmother, to my aunts, I have always been encouraged to push my ability to grow as an artist.

Diving into the graphic design world after a couple years of not knowing what I was going to do after high school, felt so natural as though I truly belonged. Everything made sense and I haven't looked back since.

Today I am continuing to grow as a graphic designer and am excited to expand my range of knowledge.
