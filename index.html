      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Surrounded by art influences all my life, from my father, to my grandmother, to my aunts, I have always been encouraged to push my ability to grow as an artist.

        Diving into the graphic design world after a couple years of not knowing what I was going to do after high school, felt so natural as though I truly belonged. Everything made sense and I haven't looked back since.

        Today I am continuing to grow as a graphic designer and am excited to expand my range of knowledge.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Gestalt Lion</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Charley Harper was a famous painter born in 1922 who had a passion for painting animals of all sorts in a style he described as “minimal realism”. He would take real life objects and break them down into the fewest possible pieces and shapes but still maintain a perfect likeness and recognition to the subject.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> To envision and reproduce any creature of our choice into a Harper-like portrait.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I did my research and studied various Harper paintings to create a portrait of an African Lion resting in the Savanna in Charley Harper’s signature style.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Chips & Dairy</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Chips n’ Dairy is a locally owned fast food business based in Ottawa that has been a part of the community for well over a decade. Having been around for years, their brand and logo was starting to look outdated.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> I was presented with the opportunity to rebrand Chips n’ Dairy to appeal to a more modern society.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For recreating the logo, I took a modern approach and went with a more simplistic look with flat shapes and two strong contrasting colours. The logo visually depicts exactly the name of the business by being half fries (chips) and half ice cream (dairy), making it easily identifiable with or without the wordmark.
        Yellow is associated with warmth which depicts the hot meals presented at Chips n’ Dairy and blue is associated with coolness which depicts the cold dairy products served in house. These colours are instantly connected to temperatures subconsciously by the viewer which creates an instant notion of what Chips n’ Dairy offers. Also the Chips n’ Dairy wordmark was hand crafted to reflect the food made in the restaurant, always made in house.</p>
