          <p><strong>I am a graphic designer from Ottawa, Canada.</strong>
          Surrounded by art influences all my life, from my father, to my grandmother, to my aunts, I have always been encouraged to push my ability to grow as an artist.

          Diving into the graphic design world after a couple years of not knowing what I was going to do after high school, felt so natural as though I truly belonged. Everything made sense and I haven't looked back since.

          Today I am continuing to grow as a graphic designer and am excited to expand my range of knowledge. (temporary, rewrite)</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Gestalt Lion</h3>
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Charley Harper was a famous painter born in 1922 who had a passion for painting animals of all sorts in a style he described as “minimal realism”. He would take real life objects and break them down into the fewest possible pieces and shapes but still maintain a perfect likeness and recognition to the subject.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> To envision and reproduce any creature of our choice into a Harper-like portrait.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I did my research and studied various Harper paintings to create a portrait of an African Lion resting in the Savanna in Charley Harper’s signature style.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Chips & Dairy</h3>
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Chips n’ Dairy is a locally owned fast food business based in Ottawa that has been a part of the community for well over a decade. Having been around for years, their brand and logo was starting to look outdated.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> I was presented with the opportunity to rebrand Chips n’ Dairy to appeal to a more modern society.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For recreating the logo, I took a modern approach and went with a more simplistic look with flat shapes and two strong contrasting colours. The logo visually depicts exactly the name of the business by being half fries (chips) and half ice cream (dairy), making it easily identifiable with or without the wordmark.
          Yellow is associated with warmth which depicts the hot meals presented at Chips n’ Dairy and blue is associated with coolness which depicts the cold dairy products served in house. These colours are instantly connected to temperatures subconsciously by the viewer which creates an instant notion of what Chips n’ Dairy offers. Also the Chips n’ Dairy wordmark was hand crafted to reflect the food made in the restaurant, always made in house.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">CHEO Annual Report</h3>
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> CHEO (Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario) is a large children’s hospital located in Ottawa. Every fiscal period, the hospital releases an annual report containing the overviews on projects, successes, recognition and stories from the hospital that occurred the prior year.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> To create the 2016-2017 Annual Report in both English and French. Had to explore different ways to place both languages. Some ways are you can have both English and French translations side by side on the same page, or split side by side on separate pages, or have one language written continuously on one the front side then have the other language on the back side but flipped over.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I decided to have one side entirely in English and then have the flipped side in French to allow for better legibility and reduce the amount of content on a page as to not overwhelm the viewer’s eye. By doing this I allow for more white space to compliment the icons and images on the page.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">A&W Breakfast Campaign</h3>
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A&W is a proud Canadian fast food restaurant that has been around since 1919!</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> With so many fast food competitors, I had to find a brand new way to campaign the fact that A&W serves breakfast, which many people did not know about.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Originally I had decided to go with the classic A&W cartoon family that have already been around for years and have good brand recognition. But they needed a new and fresh idea that could help appeal to not only the older, already-acquainted-with audience, but also to a younger demographic. Something unique about A&W is that they only use healthy and natural ingredients, mostly coming from Canada which is very uncommon in the fast food industry. Therefore, my idea was to build my campaign around the idea that many fast food chains use artificial additives and other chemicals that we don’t know about or can even pronounce. By using a humorous approach of breakfast items coming to life and questioning/being confused with certain REAL ingredients found in breakfasts in places such as McDonald’s, the leading competitor, it grabs their attention and then makes them try and fail to pronounce these long ingredients and then it makes them question if they themselves should be eating something they can’t even say. This will them direct them to A&W, a fast food chain that you can trust to know what’s in your food.</p>
